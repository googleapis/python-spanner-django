## Installing it

Use the version of django-spanner that corresponds to your version of Django.
For example, django-spanner 2.2.x works with Django 2.2.y. (This is the only
supported version at this time.)

The minor release number of Django doesn't correspond to the minor release
number of django-spanner. Use the latest minor release of each.

```shell
pip3 install --user .
```

## Using it
After [installing it](#installing-it), you'll need to edit your Django `settings.py` file:

* Add `django_spanner` as the very first entry in the `INSTALLED_APPS` setting
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django_spanner',
    ...
]
```

* Edit the `DATABASES` setting to point to an EXISTING database

### Format

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django_spanner',
        'PROJECT': '<project_id>',
        'INSTANCE': '<instance_id>',
        'NAME': '<database_name>',
        # Only include this if you need to specify where to retrieve the
        # service account JSON for the credentials to connect to Cloud Spanner.
        'OPTIONS': {
            'credentials_uri': '<credentials_uri>',
        },
    },
}
```

### Example
For example:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django_spanner',
        'PROJECT': 'appdev-soda-spanner-staging', # Or the GCP project-id
        'INSTANCE': 'django-dev1', # Or the Cloud Spanner instance
        'NAME': 'db1', # Or the Cloud Spanner database to use
    }
}
```

## Limitations

Limitation|Comment|Resolution
---|---|---
Lack of DEFAULT for columns|Cloud Spanner doesn't support using DEFAULT for columns thus the use of default values might have to enforced in your controller logic|
Lack of FOREIGN KEY constraints|Cloud Spanner doesn't support foreign key constraints thus they have to be defined in code
Lack of sequential and auto-assigned IDs|Cloud Spanner doesn't autogenerate IDs and this integration instead creates UUID4 to avoid [hotspotting](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/schema-design#uuid_primary_key) so you SHOULD NOT rely on IDs being sorted|We generate UUID4s for each AutoField
Numeric values are saved as FLOAT64|Cloud Spanner doesn't support the NUMERIC type thus we might have precision losses|Decimal and Numeric are translated to FLOAT64. If Cloud Spanner adds NUMERIC in the future, you might need to migrate your columns
Optimistic transactions when running DDL and other statements|Cloud Spanner CANNOT run DDL (CREATE, DROP, ALTER) in a Transaction and CAN ONLY run them in the [DatabaseAdmin RPC]() so any mixes of DDL and other statements will make prior statements get run, DDL run, then following statements run separately|
107 unexplored Django tests|We need to run every single test in the Django test suite for 100% certainty|Currently in progress to complete the [211 test cases](https://gist.github.com/odeke-em/d3476b6cb7c3485de6aa29956ed50a75#file-all_tests-txt)
Table names CANNOT have spaces within them whether back-ticked or not|Cloud Spanner DOEST NOT support tables with spaces in them for example `Entity ID`|Ensure that your table names don't have spaces within them
Table names CANNOT have punctuation marks and MUST contain valid UTF-8|Cloud Spanner DOEST NOT support punctuation marks e.g. periods ".", question marks "?" in table names|Ensure that your table names don't have punctuation marks
Lack of stored procedures and triggers|Cloud Spanner DOES NOT support stored procedures nor triggers so if your code relies on them, you might need to move the logic into your application|Not supported
Lack of VARIANCE, STDDEV database functions|Cloud Spanned doesn't yet implement these functions|
