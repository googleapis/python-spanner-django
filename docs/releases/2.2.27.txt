Django 2.2.27 release notes
===========================

*February 1, 2022*

Django 2.2.27 fixes two security issues with severity "medium" in 2.2.26.

CVE-2022-22818: Possible XSS via ``{% debug %}`` template tag
=============================================================

The ``{% debug %}`` template tag didn't properly encode the current context,
posing an XSS attack vector.

In order to avoid this vulnerability, ``{% debug %}`` no longer outputs
information when the ``DEBUG`` setting is ``False``, and it ensures all context
variables are correctly escaped when the ``DEBUG`` setting is ``True``.

CVE-2022-23833: Denial-of-service possibility in file uploads
=============================================================

Passing certain inputs to multipart forms could result in an infinite loop when
parsing files.
